The demo project is a simple rigid body physics-based game with a plane and some cubes on top which the user can shoot spheres/balls at from the camera (the user's head) which then bounce off in the real-world environment.

[HoloFame](https://github.com/teichgraf/HoloFame) - This is a Unity Project for HoloLens used in the #HoloTouringFall conference sessions Real World HoloLens Development with Unity by Rene Schulte presented at Unite LA 2016 and VRDC 2016. The demo project is a simple HoloLens demonstrating how to interact with thereal-world environment. The project implements the basic HoloLens input and output paradigms like GGV:

[Planetarium](https://github.com/ActiveNick/Planetarium) - A sample HoloLens app that uses spatial mapping to automatically place holograms within a room. This sample uses the HoloToolkit for Unity. - A sample HoloLens app that uses spatial mapping to automatically place holograms within a room. This sample uses the HoloToolkit for Unity. This is the completed version (with modifications in profress) of the Holograms 230 tutorial from the Holographic Academy, which walks developers through a complete sample project, built in Unity, that demonstrates:
-    Scanning a room to create a spatial mesh
-    Importing the spatial mesh within the Unity editor
-    Visualizing the spatial mesh
-    Processing the spatial mesh to find planes (e.g. walls, floor, ceiling, etc)
-    Testing the placement of holograms based on the processed planes
-    Occluding holograms based on the real world spatial mesh

[HoloTank Demo](https://github.com/ActiveNick/HoloTank-Demo) - Simple holographic viewer demo to show a 3D model in a mixed reality setting using Microsoft HoloLens. The demo shows a holographic tank, which was imported from the Tanks! Tutorial from Unity Essentials, introduced at Unity Training Day 2015.
-    Simple model viewer app that displays a tank floating 2 meters in front of the user at launch
-    Gaze around the space to move the tank and tap to lock the tank in place
-    Say "Rotate model" out loud to make the tank spin in place, or "Stop rotation" to stop it
-    Show or hide the spatial mesh of your environment with the "display mesh" and "hide mesh" voice commands
-    Tank idling sound now uses spatial sound on HoloLens

[HoloBot](https://github.com/ActiveNick/HoloBot) - A starter mixed reality Unity project for [Microsoft HoloLens](http://hololens.com/) that lets you interact with a floating robot head using speech recognition, and getting answers spoken back by the "bot" using Text-to-Speech. The commands sent to the bot are powered by the [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/) and [LUIS](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/language-understanding-intelligent-service-luis) from [Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services).
-    Hovering bot head (aka HoloBot) with looping ambient sound
-    Tap the HoloBot to move it to a different location, tap again to place
-    Gaze at the HoloBot to trigger the speech recognizer, you will hear a "Ping" sound
-    Speak "commands" to HoloBot using natural language
-    The HoloBot speaks back to you using Speech Synthesis (aka Text-to-Speech, or TTS)
-    All sounds and speech use spatial sound that originate from the HoloBot
-    The "brain" of the HoloBot can be any public bot built with the Microsoft Bot Framework. See bot integration instructions below

[HelloHolograms](https://github.com/ActiveNick/HelloHolograms) - A sample HoloLens technical demo initially based on the Holograms 100 tutorial from the Holographic Academy. This one uses the HoloToolkit for Unity, and it also includes additional features like shooting balls around the space, and spatial mapping to use the real world in the virtual balls physics. The spatial mesh can be visually turned on and off, though it always remains active for collision detection. 
- The latest version was built in Unity 5.5.0b6 (Preview).
-    Displays a cube 2 meters in front of the user.
-    Use voice commands to switch between "Pickup mode" and "Shooting mode" (default at start).
-    Pickup Mode: Air tap the cube to make the cube follow your gaze for placement. Tap again to place the cube.
-    Shooting Mode: Shoot white balls into the environment by air tapping in the space; watch them bouce around the real-world space thanks to spatial mapping on the HoloLens.
-    Spatial sound effects when shooting balls and when balls collide with the floor, environment and each other.
-    Show or hide the spatial mesh of your environment with the "display mesh" and "hide mesh" voice commands.

[DesertShooterVR](https://github.com/ActiveNick/DesertShooterVR) - Sample first-person-style shooter game for virtual and mixed reality. The goal is to demonstrate how to create a Virtual Reality-style experience using the Microsoft HoloLens. This is inspired by the kind of semi-immersive reality found in other projects like the HoloTour. HoloLens-based "VR" also has the advantage of allowing room-scale movement without any separate tracking equipment. The military base in this sample is actually quite huge and it would otherwise be very hard (i.e. impossible) to track the user accurately as they walk around the base if you had to install external tracks (e.g. HTC Vive) and if the user was tethered to a PC. You'll need a "convention center"-size space to truly walk all over the map, but most of the action is meant to be played from the center of the map. This is a work in a progress that I am sharing publicly as I add features. The latest version was built in Unity 5.5.0b10 (Preview).

[Holo-Roll-a-Ball](https://github.com/ActiveNick/Holo-Roll-a-Ball) - Holo-Roll-a-Ball is a HoloLens version of the starter tutorial for Unity with adapted features. This is a work in progress. The latest version was built in Unity 5.5.0b6 (Preview).
-    Playing board floats in front of the user when the game starts
-    Move the board with your gaze and tap to lock in place
-    Move the player ball with an Xbox One S Bluetooth controller, or the WASD / arrow keys on a Bluetooth keyboard
-    Pick-up yellow cubes around the game board to score points, without falling off the board. If the ball falls off, it'll drop to the physical floor where the board is placed
-    Show a basic UI for scoring & end of game
-    Say the voice command "Reset Game" out loud to reset the player ball to the center of the board
-    Show or hide the spatial mesh of your environment with the "display mesh" and "hide mesh" voice commands
-    Ambient spatial sound during the game
-    NOTE: I deliberately did NOT add walls to make the game more challenging.
-    The current UI implementation follows the basic Unity UI created in the Roll-a-Ball tutorial from Unity. It's basic for standard games, but doesn't work by default in VR and Mixed Reality projects. I set the UI Canvas Render Mode to Main Camera (Camera) which works in VR & HoloLens, but again isn't ideal. My next goal is to add a better Spatial UI in a future version.
-    I was initially forced to play the initial version of Holo-Roll-a-Ball with a Bluetooth keyboard due to Unity-HTP issues, but I added support for the Xbox One S controller via a plugin. I will eventually remove the plugin and upgrade to the full Input Manager in Unity to support all Bluetooth controllers for a better experience.
